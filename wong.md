Assistant Professor

My research interests are in cryptographic protocols, data privacy, data security and biometric authentication. The main focus of my work is on the conciliation of privacy, security, and privacy awareness. My ultimate research goal is to help users to protect their data privacy in this technology era. However, my research interests are not limited to the above topics/areas.
