Assistant Professor

My research interests include: biomedical signal processing and signal processing for audio and music, theory of analog-to-digital conversion, presheaves and lattice valued logics, and data-driven mobile application development.  I am also currently investigating ways to build algebraic models for abstraction and compositional structures.
