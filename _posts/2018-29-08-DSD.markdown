From 29th to 31st August 2018, I traveled to Euromicro/DSD 2018 conference in Prague, Czech Republic. I presented a joint paper entitled "Algorithm Selection for Non-Linearly Separable Algorithms in Computer Vision" written with the cooperation of my students Nadira Izbassarova and Albina Li. 

Congratulations!
