Theorem Proving in PCL

Partial Classical Logic (PCL) is a three-valued logic that I 
introduced in 2009-2010 with the goal of modelling partial functions
in mathematics and programming. 

In 2012, I developed theorem proving methods for PCL, 
based on geometric logic. 
I turned out that these theorem proving methods are not
just a collection of tricks, but that they provide some real
insight into the nature of PCL. It let to the following indirect results:
- A clarification of the relation between classical logic,
  PCL and 3-valued Kleene logic. 
- A new calculus Seq(\preceq) for PCL, with a somewhat unusual semantics, 
  which has more readable and shorter proofs than its predecessor
  (Seq2PCL). 

And of course, I will explain how to do the theorem proving:
First translate PCL into Kleene logic, and after that 
use any of the standard techniques (resolution, semantic tableaux,
geometric logic) with minimal adaptation.
