Assistant Professor

1. High-performance computing for physical processes simulation: I am interested in application of CPU-GPU hybrid computing methods (OpenMP, MPI, CUDA, Xeon PHI technologies) for resource challenging tasks. In particular I am interested in the ways different technologies can be combined in order to boost computational speed of personal and mobile devices, perform both computation and visualization of physical and technological phenomena. Perspective topics of research will be formulated around applying GPU resources of mobile devices in combination with distributed computing resources in order to solve resource demanding numeric problems.<br/>

2. Multi-agent systems: I am interested in problems of reaching consensus and voting in multi-agent systems. In particular I am looking into agents state replication (using finite-state machine) and proof of agent models. I would also be interested in industrial application of agent paradigms, and system engineering using autonomous agent systems. Perspective topics of research will be formulated around conducting experiments and building libraries of autonomous agent behaviors.<br/>

3. Information processing models and tools: I am also interested (but have not been recently active) in information processing models. This would include big data collection and processing frameworks, application of processing tools, such as Hadoop or Spark, social network mining, etc. Perspective topics of research would be formulated around big data processing and visualization frameworks, including application of HPC technologies in order to enhance big data platforms and tools.<br/>
