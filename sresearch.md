The framework that students can do research in computer science is shown on the image. Students are allowed to participate in research projects as soon as they entered third year of their undergraduate studies. This is done by the two available modules of directed studies; one in fall and one in spring term. The research project can be extended during the summer term by taking a internship where the students can focus on implementation and building either an application or release code of their learned knowledge.

Entering fourth year, students can continue their research by taking the required course Senior Project I and can further advance their research in the spring term by taking the optional Senior Project II.

If the student decide to continue Master's of computer Science, he/she can continue their research project as a part of their Graduate thesis. 

In all research interested students can get three years of active reserch activity giving a great advantage and preparation for both industry and PhD.
