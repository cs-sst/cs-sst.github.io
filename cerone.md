Associate Professor

Antonio Cerone obtained his Masters Degree in Information Science in 1989 and his PhD degree in Computer Science in 1993, both at the University of Pisa. Before joining NU he  worked at the Goethe University Frankfurt, the University of South Australia, The University of Queensland, the United Nations University and the IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca. He still holds visiting positions at IMT and the University of Pisa.
Antonio’s research interests focus on the use of formal methods in various application domains: software engineering, human computer interaction, systems biology and ecology.
Further research areas include: cognitive science, process mining and conformance analysis, analysis of Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) communities and development, collaborative learning.
