Directed Study (DS) is the main framework to allow students performing research with the faculty. DS is a graded course and requires deliverable to be provided as justification for the grade. The idea behind DS is to give student an opportunity t start, continue or finish a research project. The desired outcome of DS is a publication or at least submission of a paper to a conference or a journal. 

Details of DS depend on the supervising faculty. DS can be used to provide student a study time to start a research, learn literature or write a review of current state-of-the-art research in some research field. 

DS can be taken up to two times starting with the 3rd year of undergraduate studies.

A student willing to undertake DS must have an adviser from Computer Science and it must be on a topic in computer science.
